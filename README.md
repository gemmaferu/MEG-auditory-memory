# MEG-auditory-memory
Here you will find the scripts used for the analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in auditory memory paradigms and source reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

The functions were originally created by Dr. Leonardo Bonetti (https://github.com/leonardob92/LBPD-1.0.).
